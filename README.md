# General-Code
Just a general repo of code - I am currently in training for Front-End Dev (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and UX-Design (Currently meme-ing it up with Google/Coursera UX Courses. It's actually pretty fun! Let's talk if you're interested/doing courses as well).

Nothing much else to see here though!
